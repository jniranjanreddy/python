What is mean by OOPs.

In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming. The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data
```

```
Class - A class is a blueprint/Templare/Plan/Model/Design
Objects - A physical Existance of a Class, an Instance of a Class
Referance Variable | 
       1. The variable which can be used to refer object is called reference variable
       2. By using reference variable, we can perforn required operations on the Object
       3. By using reference variable we can access properties and methods of an object
       4. An Object can have multiple variables.

Three Types of Variables..
    1. Instance Variable - Object level Variable
    2. Static Varibales - class level variable
    3. local variable - MethodLevel Variables

Methods: 
Three types of Methods
    1. Instance method
    2. Class Method
    3. Static Methods
```


## Class classname:
        """ Documetation String """
        # variables ---> Properties/attributors
          3 Types of variables are allowed
                1. Instance Variables (Object Level variables)
                2. Static Variables   (Class Level Variables)
                3. Local variables    (Methos Level Variables)
         
        # methos --> Methods/Actions/Behavious
          3 Types are Methods are allowed
                1. Instance Methos
                2. Class Methos
                3. Static methods
